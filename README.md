In a few words, this project tries to become ***"The SQL of Social Media Channels"***.

# Description

The **Social Media Scripting Framework** is a PowerShell-based environment that abstracts the complexities of modern **Social Media Channels** from the **PowerShell** command-line. This enables any regular user (arguably, a 'power user') to leverage the content, connections and relationships of those channels in a completely new way.

Web technologies work nicely as User Interfaces. However, the aim of this project is to explore the possibilities a new 'form factor' for consuming and exploiting 'social content' and 'social relationships' in a **decentralized** and **cloud-independent** way.

This Framework is not for software developers, although they could actually enjoy it too. In fact, it provides **easy to learn abstractions and constructs** so that any user (arguably, 'power user') can play with the 'Social Universe' and connect it with his/her information store of choice in a convenient way. In other words, empowers the 'Information Worker 2.0' with new tools and capabilities to develop his/her work.
