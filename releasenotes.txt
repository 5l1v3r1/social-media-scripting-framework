B. KNOWN ISSUES:
   =================================================================================================

1. Facebook:

   + Current implementation doesn't make consume the Facebook Insights API.
   + Prospect list is known to be accurate though incomplete (only the first four elements of each
     entity seem to get reported). It seems to be a problem or a limitation on the current
     implementation of the Facebook Module.

2. Feeds:

   + Despite having well defined and standard formats, parsing RSS feeds in the real world without
     any flaws represent quite a significant challenge. If you'd ever tried, you know what I mean...
     The current version does a "decent" job, but I am afraid that it is still far from being
     perfect.

     Eventually, you will find some errors on data acquisition coming from these formats. I have
     tested current implementation against thousands of posts in different formats. However, my
     experience shows that this happens on a small percentage of them. Anyway, you should know that
     this could, occasionally, happen.

     Hopefully, this will be improved on future versions ... ;-)

3. Excel Datasets:

   + The Excel library used (EPPlus) might find a "hard time" with certain Excel files. This
     situation has been reproduced during the test phase. However, the alternative of using
     Microsoft Excel via COM Autoamation is not considered "suitable" because of its serious
     performance limitations: it took it almost 2 hours to read a 100 lines from a file.

     WORKAROUND:

     The nature of the Social Media Scripting Framework is very "data focused". As a result, the
     only thing we need is to be able to read and write data back and forth. Should you find any
     problem, just copy your raw dataset into a new and clean workbook; do your processing and copy
     the data back into the original sheet.

     Eventually, I will find a library that minimizes problems on this area. In the meantime, we
     shall live with this workaround.

4. General:

   + Current Libraries don't work reliably under a PowerShell Module. However, they do work
     perfectly fine as standalone functions under the context of the 'Social Media Scripting
     Console'. The source of this problem is still under research.



C. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
   =================================================================================================

   Last, but not least, I would like to thank anyone that have helped me in anyway achieving this
   milestone.

   Some of you have helped by fixing bugs, providing feedback or when I was blocked with weird
   coding issues. Others have shared code so that I could learn from your contributions. In addition
   to those that have helped me with the technology, I would also like to thank all off you that
   have encouraged me and supported me so that I was able to go on.
